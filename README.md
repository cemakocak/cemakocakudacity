# Udacity Data Scientist Project: Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post 

"Write a Data Science Blog" project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Before starting project, I learned CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. This methodology is followed to make data analysis and prediction with Seatle Airbnb data before writing data science blog post in Medium.

## Project Motivation

With Seatle Airbnb Data, I define three business question before starting analysis:

1.How do Seatle accommodation prices monthly change to observe season impact on price?

2.What is the most popular amenities in Seatle Airbnb Listing Data?

3.What are the most influential factors to estimate price in Seatle Airbnb Listing Data?

## Medium Blog Post
Medium blog post I have written:

### File Descriptions

1.calendar.csv: Seatle Airbnb calendar dataset is available from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data#calendar.csv This dataset includes listing id and the price and availability for that day. 

2.listings.csv: Seatle Airbnb listing dataset is available from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data#listings.csv) This dataset includes full descriptions and average review score for listed places. 

3.Data_Science_Blog_Post_Seatle_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook file with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations.

### Libraries and Installing

I use Python3. In Jupyter Notebook, related libraries used in data analysis are listed below:

Numpy
Pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
Sklearn
Seaborn
Math
